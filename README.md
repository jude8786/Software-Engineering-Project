# Software-Engineering-Project
22th Oct: Name, Project and GitHub [5 Points]
01st Dec: First Deliverable with good content [15 Points]
20th Jan: Final GitHib with all Tasks

A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. The code in GitHub can be relatively simple (e.g. simple game with console output). The doc can be short! (in contrast to the one below)

B) Make sure each person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture:

Use and understand Git!
UML at least 3 good different diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all the tools to view them!
Requirements:
Analysis:
A) DDD: If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 100 Mio â‚¬ from Edlich-Investment!) (B) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with >4 Domains coming from an Event Storming (A). Drop your Domains into a Core Domain Chart (C) and indicate the Relations = Mappings (! see MIRO examples again) between the Domains!
Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine.
Clean Code Development: A) At least 5 points you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & B) >>10 points on your personal CCD cheat sheet. E.g. a PDF.
Build Management with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could be also disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) => to be merged with 7!
Continuous Delivery: show me your pipeline using e.g. Jenkins, Travis-CI, Circle-CI, GitHub Action, GitLab CI, etc. E.g. you can also use Jenkins Pipelining or BlueOcean, etc. But at least insert more than 2 script calls as done in the lecture! (e.g. also call Ant or Gradle or something else).
Integrate some nice unit tests in your Code to be integrated into the Build
Use a good IDE and get fluent with it: e.g. VSCode IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!
DSL Create a small DSL Demo example snippet in your code even if it does not contribute to your project (hence it can also be in another language).
Functional Programming: prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
only final data structures
(mostly) side-effect-free functions
the use of higher-order functions
functions as parameters and return values
use closures / anonymous functions
You can also do it outside of your project. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.

The complete documentation must be found in a public GitHub or the system you use.

For B) Please give me a hint as a checklist for each numbered 1-13 points (!!!): where I can find the info for your solutions best as links (!) in the README.md !! (e.g. to code)

It must explain also part B in 1-2 paragraphs per point! So list the 11 numbered points here and use links here to refer to the respective files (e.g. the CCD files or test files)!

The contribution in Moodle is just a Link to GitHub in the comment section!

And: I do not want to receive 50 invitations to your repo, because your repo is private! Make it public and close it a few days after the grading! (see FAQ)

Another final remark: Mostly, I want your personal experiences with Screenshots and personal text!

Please do not write or generate ChatGPT content like "a DSL is blah blah blah, Build Management is blah blah blah...".

This is not needed, and LLM / internet-generated content will result in failing the course!
