A) Project Objective and Motivation
Objective: Develop a small pet project as a way to re-engage with coding. This project, shared on GitHub, will be simple (e.g., a console-based game) and accompanied by concise documentation.

Motivation: I've realized that one of the toughest parts of financial management isn't just adhering to a budget but understanding where my money actually goes. Countless times, I’ve found myself sifting through bank statements, notes, and forgotten receipts to piece together my monthly expenses. This chaotic process made budgeting difficult and often led to overspending without any clear insights. With this app, I aimed to make financial tracking straightforward, helping myself and others stay organized and on budget. Now, instead of relying on scattered notes and receipts, I can view my finances in a clear, comprehensive way. This project also serves as a tool for others who want to set up their own expense tracking systems and better understand their spending habits.

Traditional methods, like notebooks and spreadsheets, were cumbersome and prone to errors. While there are various budgeting apps available, I wanted to create a customized solution that met my specific needs and provided instant clarity.

B) Detailed Project Checklist
Below is a checklist addressing each of the points outlined in the learning objectives, with explanations.

Use and Understand GIT:

Basic Git commands were used throughout the project, including branching, merging, and experimenting with time travel techniques.
UML Diagrams:

Created at least three different UML diagrams: Use Case, Component, and Class Diagrams, exported for easy viewing.
Requirements Documentation:

Developed 5-10 requirements and documented them in tools like Airtable or Notion, with additional integration into a professional tool such as Jira. Mentioned the use of AI/LLMs for assistance.
Analysis:

Created a personalized checklist from the ‘ANA - Analysis’ learning unit, and conducted a detailed analysis spanning at least two pages. This included 10-15 key points with brief explanations.
Domain-Driven Design (DDD):

Conducted event-storming to discover relevant domains.
Charted these domains into a Core Domain Chart and illustrated their relationships and mappings.
Metrics:

Included project metrics such as SonarQube analysis and additional non-trivial metrics.
Clean Code Development (CCD):

Demonstrated at least 5 clean code practices in the codebase, with explanations for why they are considered clean.
Attached a personal CCD cheat sheet (PDF) with >10 points.
Build Management:

Employed a build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) to automate processes like documentation generation and testing.
Continuous Delivery:

Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, with at least two scripts as seen in the course.
Unit Tests:

Integrated comprehensive unit tests with the codebase.
IDE Proficiency:

Used a preferred IDE (e.g., VSCode or IntelliJ) and documented the favorite shortcuts and techniques.
DSL Implementation:

Included a demonstration of a Domain-Specific Language snippet in the project.
Functional Programming:

Demonstrated the use of functional programming aspects like side-effect-free functions, closures, and higher-order functions.
Bonus: Set up and documented an AI-powered coding environment.

Documentation: Ensure all related documents, code snippets, and screenshots are accessible and organized within the README. The project and documentation aim to share personal experiences and practical insights gained during the process.

Submission Reminder: Please share only a public link to your GitHub repository in Moodle for evaluation. Repositories should remain public until grading is complete, then may be switched to private.
